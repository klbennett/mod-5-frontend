I apologise for not being able to attend the pancreatic cancer awareness event last night, but I was able to visit the pancan van&#8212;generously provided by Arnold Clark Automobiles&#8212;when it visited Aberdeen&#8217;s St Nicholas Street on Monday 12 November. I pay tribute to the three brave souls who endured a particularly cold day to hand out leaflets to raise awareness of the symptoms of and risks associated with pancreatic cancer. They told me that there was genuine interest from the members of the public who spoke to them, and that they were able to answer questions about pancreatic cancer, so it is great that the pancan van has been out around the country to raise awareness during pancreatic cancer awareness month.</p><p>I recommend the Pancreatic Cancer Scotland website for its wonderful information on the disease. The little leaflet that was given out during the pancan van visits to the cities around Scotland is very informative, too. Previously, I had not made the connection and realised that the pancreas, which we normally think of as producing the juices that help to digest food, is the organ that produces insulin. As we all know, that is really important for blood sugar levels. We get a lot of information about obesity and diabetes, but I had not understood the significance of blood sugar levels to pancreatic cancer.</p><p>It is disappointing that the causes of the majority of pancreatic cancer cases remain unknown, although&#8212;as with other cancers&#8212;being overweight, being a smoker or being diabetic, and having a family history of that type of cancer might be contributory factors, as is having had pancreatitis.</p><p>As other members said, pancreatic cancer has the lowest of all cancer survival rates, and the numbers have barely changed over the past five decades&#8212;not just in Scotland, but elsewhere. I am sure that if progress was made anywhere in the world, measures would be adopted in Scotland and elsewhere as quickly as possible in order to have better outcomes.</p><p>It is essential that the signs of possible pancreatic cancer are widely recognised so that diagnosis is made as early as possible and treatment can begin. I agree with other members that treatment should begin as quickly as possible for the cancer, because we know that that can have a good outcome, especially if the cancer has not spread to other organs&#8212;in which case, people can have a particular procedure, called the Whipple procedure.</p><p>Pancreatic Cancer Scotland&#8217;s website says that</p><p>&#8220;NHS treatment in Scotland is as good as anywhere in the world, and patients can rest assured that they will be looked after properly.&#8221;</p><p>As someone else said, it is absolutely vital that people have the support of family and friends and that they know what to do. Of course, that is where other organisations come into play, including Macmillan Cancer Support, Marie Curie and Maggie&#8217;s Centres, all of which are active in Aberdeen and elsewhere. I love that there is a Whipple warriors Facebook group, on which people who have had the Whipple procedure can share their experiences and advice.</p><p>Perhaps this is the place that Miles Briggs visited; research called precision panc is being funded and carried out in the Wolfson Wohl cancer research centre in Scotland, and elsewhere. The aim of the research is to improve diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Increasingly, it uses understanding of genome sequencing. Again, Scotland is world-leading in diagnosing the disease.</p><p>I am sure that everyone here wishes that there will be a breakthrough in early diagnosis and treatment of what is a terrible disease.</p>","collapsed":0,"relevance":43,"extract":"...as producing the juices that help to digest food, is the organ that produces insulin.

In moving the motion, I make the point that our overall aim is to improve the health of the nation, and preventing ill health and reducing health inequalities are central to achieving that.</p><p>In June, we published a set of six interlinked public health priorities, each with prevention and early intervention at its core. They cover places and communities; the early years; mental wellbeing; alcohol, tobacco and drugs; poverty; and healthy weight and physical activity. Those priorities, which were agreed between the Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, are the most important issues to focus on, over the next decade, to improve the health of the people of Scotland.</p><p>Today I will outline the step changes that the Government is taking to meet one of those public health priorities: a Scotland where we all eat well and have a healthy weight and level of physical activity. In July, we published two complementary delivery plans that set out what needs to be done to achieve that priority. We recognise that the plans sit alongside a wide range of Government policy and action. Each delivery plan has stretching ambitions: we want to cut physical inactivity in adults and teenagers by 15 per cent by 2030, in line with the new global goal that was set out by the World Health Organization; we want to halve childhood obesity by 2030; and we want to significantly reduce diet-related health inequalities.</p><p>We have set a high bar, and rightly so. The scale of the challenge is huge and the inequalities remain persistently wide. The ambitions are underpinned by clear and comprehensive plans. I welcome support from across the chamber in addressing those twin challenges. We need to take decisive action, including restricting junk food promotions and helping more women and girls to get involved in sport and physical activities.</p><p>Let us remind ourselves why we need to act so urgently. We all know that being physically active is one of the best things that we can do for our overall physical and mental wellbeing. An active lifestyle can help to prevent heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal conditions and a number of cancers, but it is about more than that. Physical activity has a unique power to inspire and motivate us. It can also play a crucial role in tackling social isolation and developing confidence. In short, being active is about all of us enjoying healthy lives and being connected to our communities and our environment.</p><p>Overall levels of physical activity in Scotland remain steady, while other developing countries show decline. Given its many benefits, we want to go further and see those levels increase.</p><p>The case for change is even more stark when it comes to diet and healthy weight. We should be in no doubt about the scale of the challenge. We are consistently failing to meet our dietary goals: 65 per cent of adults are overweight or obese and over a quarter&#8212;26 per cent&#8212;of children are at risk of being overweight or obese. That is a shocking statistic, particularly given that overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults, with all the health inequality that that brings.</p><p>Obesity is the second-biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking. It is the most significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes and it can also increase the risk of lots of conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and arthritis. If we can bring down the rates of obesity and drive up the rates of physical activity, we can prevent the burden of health harms on our children, on adults and on the national health service, and the people of Scotland will live longer, healthier and happier lives.</p><p>Both plans have three core priorities. They seek to address health inequalities by supporting everyone to have active lifestyles and healthy diets, they recognise the importance of collective leadership and broad ownership nationally and locally, across the public, private, third and community sectors, and they prioritise cross-portfolio approaches to ensure that policies across the Government&#8212;not just in the health portfolio&#8212;support the changes that are needed. Let me turn to the detail in each of the plans.</p><p>In July, I launched &#8220;A More Active Scotland: Scotland&#8217;s Physical Activity Delivery Plan&#8221;, which sets out a range of 90 actions that we and our delivery partners are taking to encourage and support people in Scotland to be more active more often. Partnership working is a central theme. Our plan follows the publication of the WHO&#8217;s &#8220;Global action plan on physical activity 2018&#8211;2030&#8221;. The WHO plan sets the challenges that countries around the world face in helping people to get and stay active. It highlights how so many aspects of modern life, including transport, technology and changes in work and leisure activities lead us towards inactivity. The WHO plan makes it clear that a whole-system approach is crucial to success. That means working across policy boundaries to improve education, transport, health, planning and sport sectors, among others.</p><p>I am extremely pleased that the WHO has welcomed our delivery plan and that it sees Scotland as being ahead of the game in responding to its global action plan.</p>","collapsed":13,"relevance":35,"extract":"...all know that being physically active is one of the best things that we can do for our overall physical and mental wellbeing.

There are 190,000 UK expats living in other parts of the EU, many of whom are retired, as well as 50 million British citizens who  travel to the EU on their holidays and on business every year, and they all need access to healthcare. Since 2004, they have been able to benefit from the European health insurance card, which has made it much easier for them to access medical care when travelling through the EU, and it is extremely important that we do all we can to ensure that our citizens can continue to benefit from easy access to healthcare, whether they are at home or overseas. I therefore welcome the Bill, and the fact that it gives us the ability to extend these provisions to other third countries.</p><p pid=\"c358.0/2\">Last year, I led a Westminster Hall debate on the wide array of consumer issues that would need to be dealt with in the Brexit negotiations. At that time, I felt that a lot of the focus was on the impact on business, and that not enough consideration was being given to the impact on consumers. I have been rereading the speech that I gave in that debate more than 12 months ago, and I am extremely pleased that the issues that I raised in it were then addressed by the Government&#8217;s White Paper before the summer. I believe that those points will now have made their way into the 500-page text that the Cabinet are looking at today. I am not going to comment on those 500 pages of text until I have seen them, because unlike some colleagues, I do not have magic reading glasses that allow me to read text that is not even available or to comment on it before I have even seen it. However, I will be looking out for the elements that affect individuals, consumers and patients, to ensure that they are covered in the deal. I believe that they will be, and the EHIC is just one of those issues.</p><p pid=\"c358.0/3\">It is important that we do not go over the top and promise that the EHIC can do things that it cannot do. For example, it does not cover repatriation, so anyone who has a crash on their skiing holiday would get emergency care under the scheme but they would not be covered for getting back to their home base. In my previous role as a Member of the European Parliament, I remember that we issued a press release every summer telling people not to forget their EHIC but also to think about whether they needed travel insurance as well. Members are completely right to say that, in a no-deal scenario, many other issues would face patients and that the most vulnerable people risk being the most exposed. If the cost of travel insurance does go up, it could be most challenging for them, but I am glad that Ministers are looking at that issue.</p><p pid=\"c358.0/4\">While the Health Ministers are in the Chamber, I should like to give them a big shout-out and thank them for certain other things. Somebody talked earlier about nurses. Nurse training is happening in my constituency. I know that the Minister for Health has previously talked about ensuring that there is additional funding for those entering the nursing profession after they have finished their qualification to ensure we recognise those in nursing areas where we need nurses most. I am glad that he has done that. I also want to say a big thank you today for the announcement from the NHS about diabetes monitors. That has been a major issue for some of my constituents. We must ensure that constant monitors, such as the one our Prime Minister wears, are available across the country. I was really pleased by today&#8217;s announcement. I want to say thank you very much to the NHS and to our Ministers and thank you for getting the devil that is in the detail of the Bill correct today.</p>","collapsed":0,"relevance":25,"extract":"...to ensure we recognise those in nursing areas where we need nurses most.

All of us in the chamber today know the easy answers: we know that John Logie Baird invented the television, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin and Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. However, what happens if we move to the more challenging level? What about Williamina Fleming, John Napier and Professor John Macleod? I do not see any hands raised, so I assume that ignorance is bliss. The answers are that they invented or discovered the designation system for stars, log tables and insulin, respectively.</p><p>We heard earlier, and I agree, that Scotland has a proud record of scientific excellence and that international collaboration has been a key factor. Let me give one example from history. Professor John Macleod, whom I mentioned, was an Aberdonian who emigrated to North America and shared the 1923 Nobel prize for medicine with a Canadian, Frederick Banting, for the discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921-22. Prior to that discovery, type 1 diabetes was a life-threatening condition; I speak as the convener of the cross-party group on diabetes.</p><p>I warmly welcome the Scottish Government&#8217;s debate and support the motion in Richard Lochhead&#8217;s name. In the brief time that I have, I will focus my remarks on the positive note that the EU has played in our universities over the past 45 years through two main areas. The first is the critically important access to research collaborations across the EU and beyond, facilitating what is in the jargon called curiosity-driven research and made easy by freedom of movement for our researchers and scientists. The second is the access to major research funding through the various framework funding models that we have heard about from other speakers.</p><p>We have heard a lot about the flagship horizon 2020 programme and I agree that it has been crucial in accelerating cutting-edge science across our university sector and beyond. However, on a note of caution, I read in</p><p>The Guardian</p><p>recently that there has been</p><p>&#8220;a downturn in both UK participation in, and funding from, the project.&#8221;</p><p>Across the board, there have been concerns from university vice-chancellors that UK projects are losing out, even before Brexit has taken place. I make it clear that Scotland and the UK do extremely well out of the current system, but there are concerns about the situation since the Brexit vote.</p><p>Let me give some examples. In 2017, the proportion of UK participation in horizon 2020 was 15 per cent of the total, with just under a 16 per cent share of the funding. However, the Universities UK figures show that, this year, UK participation fell to 12 per cent and UK funding fell to 13 per cent. Do not take my word for it; Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK said:</p><p>&#8220;It highlights the urgent need for clarity on the UK&#8217;s participation in Horizon 2020 beyond Brexit and, while the UK is still a member of the EU, the need to communicate that the UK universities and researchers are still eligible to participate and apply for funding through EU research and innovation programmes.&#8221;</p><p>There has been another worrying development.</p><p>The Guardian</p><p>carried out a confidential survey of the Russell group universities, which, as members will know, include the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow. It found evidence of discrimination against UK researchers, with some such researchers being asked to leave EU-funded projects. In one case that was cited by</p><p>The Guardian</p><p>, an EU project officer recommended that a lead investigator drop all UK partners from a consortium because Britain&#8217;s share of the funding was not guaranteed.</p><p>Another key aspect is freedom of movement, which is fundamental to the EU. I believe that Scotland has benefited from the ability to attract world-leading scientists to embark on global research projects because of the UK&#8217;s membership of the EU. It has also given our early career researchers the opportunity to travel freely across the EU, to develop new ideas and products with their peers and to bring that knowledge back to Scotland. I think that it was Tavish Scott who mentioned the letter from leading academics across Scotland that was published</p><p>The Sunday Times</p><p>. They said:</p><p>&#8220;We cannot and must not allow Scotland and the UK to lose the leading role they have in these networks, as it is not easily replaced. Unfortunately, we are already seeing a loss of leadership in research collaboration since the Brexit vote.&#8221;</p><p>It is useful to look at the total funding that Scotland received from framework programme 7, which is the programme that preceded horizon 2020. It received &#8364;729.5 million, including &#8364;3 million for marine renewables research at the UHI in my region. Such projects make a real difference to innovation across the region. They often build on the platform of major structural fund investment over the past three decades, which has made such a difference to my region&#8217;s economy. There were plans to develop in key sectors, such as renewables and the health sciences, in the remainder of the horizon 2020 programme and as part of the future horizon Europe activity, but those plans have been limited as a result of Brexit.</p><p>Time is against me, so I will make a final key point. We probably need the predictive powers of the Brahan seer to be able to identify the next steps in the Brexit process. The challenge for Scotland in the future is twofold. We need to maintain the spend on research and use every technique to secure the best and brightest talent from across Europe and beyond.

Friend for coming here this evening. Her presence is another example to the Minister of how the new hospital in Harlow is supported across Essex. She is a brilliant constituency MP, and she is absolutely right about the staff she mentions in her part of our national health service.</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/2\">To add insult to injury, the layout of the hospital is convoluted and nonsensical. That is evident to any patients seeking urgent care or any visitor looking to find their loved one. As the former Health Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Philip Dunne\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/11696\">the Member for Ludlow (Mr Dunne)</phrase>, noted in my first debate in July 2017, the hospital suffers from &#8220;sub-optimal clinical adjacencies&#8221; due to the development of temporary structures. To those who suggest that refurbishment would be a more suitable and less costly solution, I cannot emphasise enough that that is not looking to the long term. The tangled layout of the current hospital, comprising add-on structures and sporadic urgent care, is a direct consequence of short-term financial fixes; my case in point that an Elastoplast solution will no longer stick.</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/3\">Aside from the natural degradation of the estate over time, the hospital is now forced to deal with new pressures stemming from a rising population and the downgrading of other local healthcare facilities, including Chase Farm Hospital and the Queen Elizabeth II. Cracks are already evident in the accident and emergency department. Back in 1966, the A&amp;E unit was designed for approximately 60,000 attendances per year. It is currently seeing 68% more than that, with 200 to 300 attendances per day. That figure is 10% higher than the national average and, against its size, places the hospital as the busiest A&amp;E department in England.</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/4\">In the latest board meeting of directors in October 2018, it was suggested that July 2018 was</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1348.1/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the busiest ever month&#8230;at the Trust&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/6\">for the A&amp;E,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1348.1/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;with attendances as high as 9,400&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/8\">in that single month. The influx of patients is only set to continue, with the relocation of Public Health England to Harlow hosting as many as 2,750 workers based at the site, as well as the Gilston Garden Town development, providing 8,500 new homes in Harlow, and the near-completion of Junction 7A on the M11. Does the Minister acknowledge that to support the trust in meeting the 95% four-hour access target, the Government must do all they can to alleviate such pressure? Does he further recognise that the new, expanded health campus would alleviate this immediate pressure, but also future-proof the hospital, accounting for further population growth?</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/9\">I am grateful for the Government&#8217;s capital investment to realise Harlow&#8217;s strategic economic and housing plans, but I ask for the same treatment for our comprehensive healthcare plan. It is not the infrastructure alone that is a burden on the staff. Staff shortages&#8212;the hospital frequently operates at an 11% vacancy rate&#8212;stem from widespread difficulties in recruiting and retaining well-qualified employees. That is due in particular to Harlow&#8217;s proximity to London. According to the leadership team at the hospital, the opportunity for career development, or lack thereof, is a much more significant sticking point for potential recruits.</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/10\">State-of-the-art facilities and a quality healthcare campus would at least offer the hospital the chance to enter the same race. The new campus and medical training facilities would allow the hospital both to attract and retain the very best staff. It would become an apprenticeships and skills centre, offering high-class, nursing degree apprenticeships.</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/11\">The spiralling health crisis makes the urgency of the hospital campus all the more pressing. According to the Essex local authority portrait, Harlow has the highest rate of premature deaths attributed to cardiovascular diseases and the third highest rate of diabetes in the country. Hospital staff also deal with high rates of substance misuse, and 66.1% of adults are classed as overweight, which is higher than the national average. Harlow has the largest proportion of 10 and 11-year-olds classed as overweight or obese in the country, at 36.2%. There are many reasons why west Essex should have a health campus fit for the 21st century, but these figures clearly evidence a need.</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/12\">At the former Secretary of State&#8217;s recommendation, the trust put forward its strategic outline case&#8212;SOC&#8212;in August 2017. The board, clinical commissioning group and local authority partners, together with KPMG, concluded that the health campus model would be</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1348.1/13\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the most affordable solution for the local system&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/14\">and</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1348.1/15\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;would deliver the most benefit to our population&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/16\">Since my last debate in July 2018, the timescale for the development plans have changed and the plans are currently in the NHS and NHS Improvement assurance process. The trust is working closely with commissioners, patients and the public to develop a pre-consultation business case and refresh its SOC.</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/17\">In my debate in October 2017, the former Health Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, so helpfully highlighted:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1348.1/18\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The extent to which there is capital available to support very significant projects will depend on how much is made available by the Treasury.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-10-18\">18 October</phrase> 2017; Vol. 629, c. 352WH.]</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/19\">As was also noted in the debate,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1348.1/20\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;upgrading services on this important site will be a priority for a Conservative government&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-10-18\">18 October</phrase> 2017; Vol. 629, c. 347WH.]</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/21\">I take this opportunity to thank the Government for the announcement of &#163;20.5 billion additional annual funding for the NHS, and I ask, in the light of this spending and the end of austerity, as the Prime Minister and the Chancellor said, is this not the most apt time to provide the Princess Alexandra Hospital with the bright future that it is determined to have?</p><p pid=\"a1348.1/22\">My hon. Friend the Minister has gone out of his way to meet me and the chief executive of the hospital trust and to listen to his concerns and mine, and I cannot say how appreciative I am of that. As a key area of contention for my residents, I would be grateful to receive an update on the progress of this funding and a timescale for the economic investment plans. The issues that the hospital faces today are preventable, but all of them are beyond the control of the hard-working staff, patients and visitors. This is on the Government to act. This is on the Treasury and the Department of Health and Social Care to see reason and allocate the necessary funding for a new healthcare campus in west Essex.</p>","collapsed":0,"relevance":18,"extract":"...campus all the more pressing.

We have heard how many factors shape the life chances, welfare and social mobility of young people. Poverty alleviation, parenting and early educational intervention all have proven impacts, but austerity over the past eight years has had major adverse effects.</p><p pid=\"b1447.0/2\">The Local Government Association told us that, after core reductions of &#163;16 billion, local authorities have largely managed to protect social care, but there has been a substantial increase in demand. For example, there has been a 158% increase in demand for child protection services in serious cases where a child is suffering significant harm. Spend has tended to move away from preventive and early help work into services to protect children who are at immediate risk of harm. Councils predict a further funding gap for children&#8217;s services of at least &#163;3 billion by 2025, and that does not take account of any further rise in demand.</p><p pid=\"b1447.0/3\">Early intervention services face particular pressures, with demand rising but funding falling by 40% in  real terms between 2010 and 2016. The Chancellor&#8217;s &#163;84 million in the Budget to help a measly 20 local authorities reduce the number of children entering the care system is a drop in a bucket.</p><p pid=\"b1447.0/4\">In addition to service cuts, recent tax and welfare reforms have meant difficult parenting situations for many of the most vulnerable families. I find it difficult to reconcile the Government&#8217;s &#8220;You&#8217;ve never had  it so good&#8221; statements on the lowest-ever levels of unemployment and more people than ever in employment with the rising reliance on food banks. I see stagnant wages and people having to juggle several part-time or zero-hours jobs to survive, with resulting impacts on parenting. As is always the case, austerity has fallen heavily on our children. I, for one, am not convinced that its ongoing impact is over.</p><p pid=\"b1447.0/5\">Let us be less gloomy. Removal from poverty, good parenting and early educational intervention can have demonstrable effects on both life chances and indeed, as has already been said, on future health. I commend to the House and to the Government the benefits of outdoor education and encouragement of children to connect with green spaces and trees. I should declare an interest as the chairman of the Woodland Trust.</p><p pid=\"b1447.0/6\">Our children are the fattest and run the risk of being the sickest for many years&#8212;for generations, in fact&#8212;with life-shortening conditions such as type 2 diabetes being diagnosed in children at earlier and earlier ages. That will have a lifelong impact on not just their physical health but their mental health and life chances. A Sutton Trust review of research evidence identified four key dimensions of good-quality pedagogy  for all children under three. Two of these are a focus on play-based activities and routines which allow children to take the lead in their own learning and opportunities to move and be physically active, as we have already heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Bull. A study of adults has shown that walking in green open space with trees for 13 and a half minutes a day reduces the risks of depression by 50%.</p><p pid=\"b1447.0/7\">I commend to your Lordships and the Minister the work of the growing network of schools that have signed up as forest schools. These are schools where much of the teaching is based on outdoor activities and woods and offer a unique activity-based way of building independence, self-esteem and a positive attitude towards learning in children and young people as they explore and experience the natural world for themselves. The little beasts go out to learn in their local woods in all weathers and are encouraged to explore their thoughts, feelings and relationships through the use of emotions, imagination and senses. At the same time they improve their physical activity, health and mental health. The experience of a combination of freedom and responsibility is beneficial, especially to children with little confidence or challenging behaviours. The Woodland Trust is delighted to provide local woods and profuse quantities of mud for many forest schools.</p><p pid=\"b1447.0/8\">In a spirit of total self-promotion, I commend  the Woodland Trust Green Tree Schools Award,  which has rewarded 10,000 schools for competing in environmental projects and encouraging outdoor learning. I should say, of course, that other green school and educational initiatives are available. Can the Minister tell us what support the Government can give to these sorts of outdoor education initiatives? In Wales, every child born receives two trees funded by the Welsh Government. One is planted by the Woodland Trust in Wales and the family is sent the co-ordinates so that they can visit their trees. The other is planted in Uganda to help create a sustainable future for Ugandan forests and indeed, the planet. The scheme is rather confusingly called Plant!, which does not mean what noble Lords think; it is Welsh for &#8220;children&#8221;. This reinforces early in the family&#8217;s formation the importance of green open spaces and trees and encourages them to take their toddler, although we have had babes in arms as well, into the woods. Perhaps the Minister might introduce such a scheme for children in England and demonstrate the Government&#8217;s commitment to the importance of outdoor education.</p>","collapsed":0,"relevance":21,"extract":"...as the chairman of the Woodland Trust.
